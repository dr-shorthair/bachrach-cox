Well its the 23rd December and I haven't sent Xmas cards or written a chatty circular letter. 

So here's the dot-point version:

* Following some less-than pleasant treatment by one of her (indirect) bosses, and less than supportive response from the people who should have been looking after her, Amy resigned her job at Parliament mid-year. This has led to a significant improvement in mood, sleeping patterns, etc, so was definitely a Good Thing. But since then she has had two part-time, contract positions (one selling Web software/services, another writing material for an education website) and is now back at WACOSS organising their confernece 4 years after the first time she did it for them (they now have realised it was the best one they ever had!)

* Simon cut down on business-travelling this year (only 3 o/s trips) but is still in much demand both internationally and domestically, and (finally) even within his employing institution

* Abby is 2 1/2 and mostly delightful. She is very popular with both staff and the other kids at day-care, which she attends 4 days a week. She's at that "running everywhere" phase. Has mostly lost the baby-belly and finally growing some light-brown hair, with a gentle wave much to Amy's relief. Still loves music and dancing. A little too keen on the video, but we try to mix it up with Madeline, Tellytubbies, Babe, Lion King, Wallace and Grommit, Play School, Toy Story, etc. Simon takes her to "swimming" lessons one afternoon a week which is great for both of us. She likes to kiss people and things to say "hi" or "bye". If she gets upset, when she starts to calm down she asks for "bit of a walk" which she has figured out is a good settling activity. We also often go round the block just before bed, hunting skinks, slaters, snails, some of which may come home with us. Loves dogs and more or less any animal actually.

* We all went to UK and US in May/June - joined the Cox/Bland Spring-bank holiday camping trip, this year near Machynlleth (sp?), which was predictably cold and wet, though not as cold as York in 2002. Spent one ridiculous day getting to the top of Cader Idris from where we could see precisely nothing except sheep and other sodden walkers. Note, that good old Aussie elastic-sided Blundstones kept my feet dry and comfy, while some more high-tech european footwear didn't serve some of my mates so well!

* Perhaps biggest (and certainly most costly) thing this year was having a new (master) bedroom added to our house, with associated adjustments to living room, laundry, extension to deck, and loss of some back garden. We are really pleased with the result which gives us much needed space, so the computer is now out of the living room and into the study/spare-room. Big closets for us, nice Jarrah floor boards running through. Outside is smart with corrugated iron cladding (modern/fashionable in these climes) with Jarrah detailing (Jarrah is a dark red timber - local eucalypt - resembles mahogany). Work started at the beginning of July and we moved in in October, after being squeezed into half a house during construction.

* Xmas we are staying put, partly because we have 2 weddings to attend (29th Dec and 7th Jan), Simon has some work deadlines, and Amy's mom Beryl is arriving 29th Dec for two weeks. We are looking forward to the Follis's (Simon's sister & family) descending on us for the second half of March 2004.

That'll have to do. Gotta go and pick the girl up from daycare.

Here's some proud parent views.

Best wishes for Xmas and New Year to you all.

Simon, Amy and Abby
