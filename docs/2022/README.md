# The year that was 2022

Well thank goodness that's over.

2022 kicked off with the [loss of my mother](https://thelma-ruth-cox.muchloved.com). She had been obviously declining from around her birthday
at the end of November, when we had the last of our funny phone calls where we got to catch up and also
gently tease her about aging. Contact through December was an increasing struggle. I got news of her death
when I was in transit in Darwin, my departure from Australia having been delayed as I had to wait for my 3rd
COVID shot. My brother Richard had managed to travel a week earlier, and he and my sister Sarah were with
mum at the end. When I arrived it was straight into logistics. Tim was heroic as usual.

The funeral was nice. There was a big turnout, including many relatives that I
hadn't seen in decades, and lots of Blands. We re-connected with our cousins James and Michael who
were just boys around 10 years old the last time I saw them (there is now an active Whatsapp group with
Michael in particular a regular contributor). Most of the absent Australians made pre-recorded video
contributions, and there were a couple of dozen zoom participants.

Richard and I made numerous trips across to Acocks Green to visit dad in Olivet care
home which mum and dad had entered early 2020. He was mostly uncommunicative. It was unclear if he knew us,
or why we were there, or that mum was gone. While tele-communication with him had been almost nil since my
last visit in late 2019 thanks to his deafness, this was barely a shadow of my father. Sarah and Tim had
been making the unpleasant drive across south Birmingham as often as COVID allowed for two years, so the
changes had been more gradual for them. Richard and I said our farewells to him before we returned
home.

So most of January, I was at my sister's house, sharing a bedroom with my
brother for the first time in 45 years. Richard and I took advantage of this to visit a few old haunts,
including the neighbourhood in Kings Heath where mum had grown up, and in Sedgley, where we had, we looked
at the outside of both primary and secondary schools, ascended the Beacon, and had lunch at the cafe in the
church where we had attended Scouts. The old biddies serving confirmed that John Clark, who had been an
assistant leader to us, was still involved, 50 years on. For my 63rd birthday we took a very soggy walk
across some local fields and small hills. Just before returning home, Sarah, Tim, Richard and I had a short
break at Sarah and Tim's cabin just outside Hay-on-Wye, and had a cold walk in the Brecons, and a
short visit with the youngest Bland (Verity) and her new baby on their sheep and cattle farm near Llandeilo.

Travel in January was still challenging. The COVID requirements for travelling
through 3rd countries such as Singapore were impossible to parse, and changing daily, so thank goodness
Qantas had non-stops from London to Darwin. I got back to Melbourne the day of a family wedding - my second
cousin Alison's youngest daughter Danielle. We had only made contact with this branch at the beginning
of Covid. We later attended big brother James' wedding in a muddy field in November, and had Xmas day
at Alison and Bernie's in the Dandenongs, so we are all good friends now.

Melbourne had one of the longest lockdowns in the world, and getting back to
something resembling 'normal' has been a tentative process for a population with communal PTSD,
particularly with travel.

We all went to WA for a week at the beginning of June, to join the Family Bushwalkers
at Mel and Suzie's bush block, ostensibly to celebrate Gina and Abby's 21sts, and then a few
days in Perth. A real nostalgic experience for us to sit around the campfire for a couple of days with old
friends. A highlight was a Numbat sighting on a bushwalk - quite a treat as there are only about 3000 in
existence.

Then Amy and Abby both had a month in US, overlapping in New York for a couple of
weeks. Abby hadn't seen her grandmother in 8 years, and the reunion was far from smooth. Her frisbee
team had a few days in New York en route to a big competition (more below), so she took advantage of a spare
couple of hours to attempt to surprise her gran, prior to Amy's arrival. The surprise was that the
apartment door was unlocked, and there was no-one home, which was unlikely since Beryl never goes out these
days. The building staff advised that she had been taken to hospital, and a bit of sleuthing tracked down
the location. Amy arrived that evening so they both saw Beryl in A&E the next day. (She had had a fall
but was allowed home a couple of days later.)

Abby had been selected twice to represent Australia in Ultimate Frisbee in 2020 and
2021 but the competitions were cancelled. So she grabbed a chance to join a team who had a place in the 2022
World Ultimate Club Championship scheduled for
Cincinnati for July/August. However, the club was from Wollongong, so that meant a sequence of weekend trips
to NSW to train with them. Which could have been fun, if she hadn't broken her ankle in February. She
dutifully travelled anyway so that she was 'part of the team'. Then the final weekend session in
June, when she was finally back on her feet again, was washed out by heavy rain after she had travelled up. Unfortunately the competition itself was
unsuccessful both for the team, and particularly for Abby who was bowled over in play at the beginning of
day two, and suffered a concussion which ruled her out for the rest of the tournament. So a lot of effort,
time, and expense, for a very disappointing return. In September her Uni team missed the podium in nationals
despite having the best overall record (they had single point losses in two key games). So Abby is currently
taking a break from the sport.

I had a week in Germany, a couple of weeks in Canberra, and a few days in Hobart, but
otherwise just a few short trips in Victoria on a mixture of work and bushwalking. The week before
Xmas we joined our friends Ros, Leon, John, Marc and Zoi and assorted offspring camping at Wilsons Prom.
I've joined the Melbourne Bushwalking Club who have multiple outings most weeks, so I'm looking
forward to more.

Probably the highlight of the year was our engagement with the campaign of a
candidate for federal parliament, in the 21st May election. Goldstein was considered a very safe Liberal
(i.e. tory) seat. The incumbent member entered parliament after a short career in a libertarian think-tank.
I joined 'Voices of Goldstein' in early 2021, then when we managed to get a very impressive
candidate ([Zoe Daniel - ex ABC foreign correspondent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Daniel)), I signed up for the campaign. I was one of 5
'captains' who managed an effort which knocked on 45,000 doors in the electorate (note: you were
lucky to get an answer from 1-in-5). I did around 1000 personally all over the electorate, which varies from
$5M Brighton mansions to very run down public housing units, so that was an eye-opener itself. There were
many elements to the campaign, but the door-knocking was recognised as one of the most effective parts.
Zoe's victory was called relatively early Saturday evening, so we got to celebrate at a big party. The community
effort was very impressive - there were hundreds of volunteers involved, so in retrospect the incumbent
didn't stand a chance. A number of those involved stated that it was a highlight of their lives! We
have made good new friends.

However, the week leading up the election brought two difficult things. [We lost
Dad](https://phillipcox.muchloved.com/) on the Tuesday - I got the call from Sarah while door-knocking. And on the Friday - just prior to going out to set up
posters at voting venues - I got the call from my urologist with the news that my prostate had to go. My op
and Dad's funeral were on the same day in mid June, so I attended by Zoom from my hospital bed. I had
sent a video contribution recorded in Mel and Suzy's back garden in Perth.

Mum and Dad weren't the only farewells in 2022. We lost our good local
friend (and sport spectator protagonist, and dog walker) Alex who decided he'd had enough of thrice
weekly dialysis. Also the founder of my choir, and one of our sopranos - the choir performed at both of
those funerals. So a lot of funerals.

After a couple of false starts, we finally got our back garden landscaped in
November. The building work in 2021 had left one tree, one partial hedge, and a pile of dirt. Abby now has a
native garden (strong WA theme) and a pond. We have a 'food forest' - i.e. a big perma-culture
area with a mixture of leaves, fruits, and a few flowers.

And after 35 years service to CSIRO, I decided to call it quits at the end of the
year. My official retirement is the day after my birthday, but I'm on annual leave until then.

Overall, notwithstanding a couple of high points, I think we were happy to see the
back of 2022. Hope this all makes sense, and that your lives were less complicated than ours.

Simon (and Amy and Abby (and Hugo))
