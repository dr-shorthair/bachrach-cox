# What we did in 2023

A brief summary using a rather geeky platform but at least I won't lose it.

Here's the skeleton, and below that are some pictures with a few more notes and captions.

I formally retired the day after my 64th birthday, after nearly 36 years at CSIRO (with breaks at Monash Uni and the European Commission). I mostly didn't look at anything professional for 6 months, except for a few days on a prior commitment to a [project in France](https://www.onewater.fr/en). We traveled in the [Victorian high country](#Dinner-plain), up the [NSW Central Coast](#NSW) and [ACT](#parly) in the first half of the year. Then we put a load of effort into campaigning for the referendum on an indigenous voice to parliament - here's Amy's blog posts [describing the campaign](https://timelychange.wordpress.com/2023/10/12/saying-yes-to-the-voice/) and [our disappointment on the result](https://timelychange.wordpress.com/2023/11/02/saying-no-to-the-voice/). On a more positive note, we were part of a [CRISP](https://refugeesponsorship.org.au/what-we-do/crisp/) group who [welcomed and supported a small refugee family from El Salvador](#CRISP) during the second half of the year. Meanwhile, the garden is going gang-busters and supplying us with [plentiful amounts of greens, zucchini, artichokes, fennel, rhubarb and passion-fruit](#Garden), with smaller quantities of tomatoes, feijoa, a few strawberries and raspberries, and high hopes for the asparagus, kiwi-fruit, lemons, plums, figs, and blueberries in the future.

Notwithstanding the retirement, through a combination of commitments and opportunities I traveled o/s four times on someone else's tab - the most I have managed since before COVID. In March [Amy came with me to Paris](#Paris-etc), followed by short trips to UK and Belgium. In July I went to [the south of France](#Lyon-etc) and grew a beard (now removed). In September I had [a few days in Singapore](#OGC), going straight on to [a week in Germany](#Dagstuhl). Then in November I had [a few days in China](#China). Amy also had her own trip to US to see her mom and other relatives and friends in August/September. Meanwhile [Abby went to Central America](#Abby-america) with her oldest friend Gina for nearly three months from March. Abby has resumed playing Ultimate after taking a break following the disappointing campaign in 2022, and has also picked up scuba-diving which supports her long term fascination with creatures aquatic.
