# Notes on 2002

Dear friends:

Here’s a quick run-down on what happened in the Bachrach-Cox household this year.  

1. Simon did too much travelling – to North America five times, UK once, Korea once.  This was primarily in connection with projects concerning the development of transfer standards for geospatial information.  So I saw a lot of airports, hotel rooms and meeting rooms.  On two trips to Washington DC in May and July I got no further than a short taxi-ride from Dulles airport, which those of you who know the area will recall is not exactly an exciting destination.  However, in February I attended a meeting at my alma mater Lamont-Doherty just outside New York which was quite a deja-vu experience, but interesting since what I’m working on now has little connection with what I was doing then.  This trip also gave me a chance to briefly visit Amy’s mum Beryl and Hal.  In April I was in DC and had a chance to catch up with old grad-school friends Frank and Ines and their kids Ben and Julia.  We all went to UK in early June for the Jubilee … well actually I was pretty busy working again but we were able to watch all of England’s world-cup campaign with excited Poms, and also tag along to the annual Cox/Bland spring back holiday camping trip – just outside York this time.  I also got to introduce Amy to my remaining schoolfriend (Chris Wood) college friends (Laurel and Alan Townend & family) and London friend (Phil Meredith) in quick succession. July saw my third visit to Vancouver in a year, but this time was able to drop in on Perth friends Tina and Claude and kids Zizzy and Lara who are there for a year.  Only domestic travel for a few months and October I didn’t get on a single airplane, but then had a complicated journey to Gyeongju, Korea in November, which was a bit interesting as it is an old historic city.  Then I got back less than a week ago from two weeks in Sydney and Los Angeles – the latter gave me a chance to see our friend Paula who moved to LA from Perth 3 years ago, and in particular to spend a day and a half with Amy’s uncle David.  He is architect-to-the-stars so we spent a little time spying out grand houses in Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Westlake.  

2. Amy went back to work in July, on the staff of federal senator Ruth Webber (ALP).  She mostly works in her electorate office in the northern suburb, and has responsibility for organising Emily’s List in WA (raises funds to help get progressive women elected to various parliaments).  Amy has also had two work-trips – one to Canberra for a week during which I was sole-parent, then a long-weekend in Adelaide, when she took Abby along.  The promised “grandmothers” did not end up being as helpful as promised so more careful plans will be put in place next time.  Another item of interest was the rather low-life hotel they stayed in the first night, before being rescued by a local MP for the second night.  Amy is enjoying the job, and working very hard on her three days a week, but the job is definitely much less central to her life than she has been accustomed to.  The Australian way of doing things has some difference to what she was used to, but Amy has also been able to bring some ideas in from her background working in this area in the US.  Bought a nice family car (4 yo Camry wagon) on the proceeds, but the 18 yo Laser still chugging along nicely.  

3. Abby is flourishing.  She started daycare when Amy started her job, and now does four days a week.  She is very good-natured and thus very popular at daycare.  She is gentle with other kids, and definitely enjoys the company.  She probably gets more structured activities (and maybe also food!) than at home, and Amy enjoys the break, including one day without work or child.  After being an early crawler Abby took her time getting on her hind legs, and only took off at 17 ½ months, after a few staggers while Amy was in Canberra in October.  But within two days of realising that she could walk she had stopped crawling entirely except up and down stairs.  Now we can finally put her in the dresses that she hasn’t grown out of without her tripping over the hem in crawling.  Mind you, she is a little thing (she wore a couple of 3-6 month size garments this week!) so not too many things have been completely missed.  She has a good sense of humour and makes all kinds of physical jokes.  Loves playing “Boo” and very ticklish.  Dances whenever she hears music – likes disco, or anything with a strong beat.  Loves dogs and other animals, and likes to cuddle Iko our cat.  She amused us early by pretending the TV remote control was a phone, balancing it on her shoulder and saying “Lello”.  She is making lots of recognisable words now, but the sense is not precisely what you may think: "mummy" means "pick me up mummy or daddy"; "nana" means "I want a Banana please, or failing that some other tasty morsel"; "weeeee" means "there’s something going on in the nappy region"; "whishhhh" means "boob please"; "byby" and "lello" retain their conventional meanings.  Loves books, usually upside down, but often carries then around and sometimes to bed with her.  Loves to play in the kitchen with the plastic things that Amy sorted into a “safe” cupboard for her.  Recently started cuddling teddies (she has about a dozen to chose from, plus a couple of kangaroos, a sheep, and various assorted little things).  Gives a nice open mouth kiss.  

4. Amy’s mom Beryl visited again for a couple of weeks in March (I think …).  Beryl and Hal also went to UK in October and spent a weekend in the midlands with Phillip and Thelma, and got to meet Sarah and family.  

5. Two bedrooms ain’t enough, particularly when you have a computer/office to find space for, so we need to move or extend.  We have had an architect develop a plan to add a master bedroom to the back.  Today (Xmas Eve) we got a letter from the council saying the plans had received provisional approval, which was not a forgone conclusion as we are proposing variations from the standard planning regulations. Our preference is to stay in the area, which is very convenient for transportation and only a five-minute walk to cafés and shops.  Based on average costings we should get the extra room for only about twice what you pay a real-estate agent and stamp duty to move, so if we can get this we’ll feel like we are ahead.

OK – this is about what I can manage right now.  Tonight we go to Xmas eve dinner at Annie and Joe’s.  Tomorrow breakfast at Anna and Chris’s, then lunch at Gill and Marek’s.  Monday we will go down to Gill and Marek’s holiday house at Margaret River and see in the New Year with the usual culprits.
