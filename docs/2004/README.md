Dearest Friends and Family –

Happy New Year (a few months late)!  We hope this letter finds you all well and happy.  We’ll open by thanking all of you who have taken the time to send us updates of your life and families – we may not always respond promptly, but we do value hearing from you. This letter is a longer one than usual, but we hope you’ll take the time to read it, just the same. The distance we are from you makes us feel the need to share in more detail, and show you with photos, some of our life. 

Chanukah.  We celebrated Chanukah this year with a party at which Amy made latkes, lit candles on the Chanukiah and introduced Abby’s friends to dreidles. Eitan also brought homemade sufganiot (doughnuts). Abby and some of her friends are shown here examining the fish in our new water feature/ fishpond. 

Family-Building.  Last year at this time, we were still reeling from some shocking news. We’d been trying to conceive a second child since Abby was 1-1/2 and were having no luck. I was still breastfeeding a little and hoped that accounted for it. I stoppped and it didn’t. After seeing our GP and then a fertility clinic it was confirmed that, well, there was no other way to put it: I was in menopause. Not being one to take no for an answer, we looked into the remaining option of ovum donation. We are blessed with a friend and angel, Paula Griffiths, who volunteered to donate her eggs and we embarked on this process, starting with the six-month “cooling off” period required by the state. It was an amazing adventure, from the counseling to the egg collection, fertilisation, transfers and the amazing support available from other women –mostly in the US- online. Unfortunately, our three tries were unsuccessful and I, in particular, am brokenhearted. We don’t expect to try any more as the time and money we invest in that project are taken from, and unreturnable to, Abby and our existing family and social life. And all the time I thought the hard part of ovum donation was going to be getting my head around not being the baby’s genetic mother. We are left with the infinite blessing of Abby, more precious than ever for the knowledge that she will be our only child. 

Abby. They say that your kid’s childhood is over in a flash and I must say the evidence is mounting as Abby began kindy in February.  She’ll be attending kindy one or two full days a week at West Leederville Primary School as well as the kindy at Leederville Early Childhood Centre.  

Following in the great tradition of her grandma Beryl, Abby began taking ballet classes this year.  Which means, primarily, that she has learned to skip and to wiggle her hips.  Every Saturday morning we take her to class and watch from outside as they learn to:

•	catch fairies gracefully with their fingers. In case you don’t know, this is important because otherwise you squish them and get fairy goo all over your hands;
•	do “boots and ballet shoes” with their feet (flex and point for the uninitiated); 
•	make their feet smile (a gentle First position).

It all culminated last year with the end of year performance – we’re including photos of before and after the show.  The video is pretty special, though – a dozen 3-1/2 year old girls dressed up to be Oscar the Grouch and standing appropriately behind rubbish bins lovingly painted silver by their parents.  They all did the first 30 seconds or so of their dance -- wiggling their hips, pointing their feet – but then it degenerated into what resembled as many deer in the headlights until Abby just, well, took off and went to her friend’s rubbish bin to play and they broke into mayhem.  As another mother commented, at least there were signs of life. 

Amy’s work – 

Amy was back at the WA Council of Social Service again this year, defining the themes and doing the preliminary organising for their bi-annual conference to which she gave the title “Bring on the Change” after a song by Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), who spoke at the conference after being pre-selected to stand (successfully) as a Labor Member of Parliament.  I then produced WACOSS’ first promotional brochure.  

And now it’s time for a(nother) change.  After all the writing I’ve done in my life – legal arguments, press releases, policy pieces, poetry and social change writing, I’ve finally decided to begin to write freelance – for magazines, websites and whatever I can. I’ve written and edited content for three websites of the Education Department in Western Australia and am looking for more – nearby or remote, since it’s a line of work that can be done by email.  I also wrote an article for Znet about the importance of community midwifery http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=12&ItemID=4898 .  If you know of any possibilities for me, please let me know.  

Simon’s work – 

… has taken him to Canada (though Ottawa in April is nothing to get excited about – a colleague who hails from there comments “Ah yes, when the dog-turds reappear as the snow melts”), Malaysia (grabbed few days in the “oldest rainforest in the world – actually the best bit was the boat-trip in as I have seen much more wildlife in Australian rainforest), Italy (sneaked in an afternoon in San Giminiano - fantastic), Norway twice (barely saw daylight in Trondheim in November on the second trip), and Canberra a few too many times. I know what he does is very important, and I know that if the number of overseas invitations he not only accepts but has to decline is any indication, he does it exceptionally well, but I only understand it in very broad terms so I’ll let him describe it himself. I am still working on standardization for data interchange, mostly in geographic and geological information. It is based mostly on web delivery – web and grid services – and involves direct collaboration with people in US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, and occasional contact with many others, including some Australians. 

Daily Life.  One of the things we’d like most to share, but is most difficult to capture, is the flavour of our daily life.   Perth is an amazing place to live if you have a young child.  At the moment, Abby goes to kindy two days at the local primary school as well as to daycare one day, where Simon is on the Management Committee.  

I made the decision a long time ago that I wanted to work only part-time to take more advantage of the gift of Abby while not abandoning completely my need to work.  Although I feel strong pangs of envy of some of my very professionally successful friends, and the decision has had major consequences on the kind of work available to me, it has meant that I have real time with Abby that allows us the joys of the incidental times. I have the luxury of being able to walk Abby to and from school.  We take advantage of our walk to name the people we know in the neighborhood as we pass their houses, name the streets and flowers – Brighton, agapanthus, Coldstream, plumbago, Woolwich, lavendar -- count skinks, chat with local cats and dogs and pick lilly-pilly berries for eating. 

The other days we spend together and with Simon going alone or with friends to do any of a number of great activities including:

The Beach.  Several local beaches have great shaded playgrounds, cafes and beaches that are not so threatening for a little girl who is not quite comfortable with the surf she’ll soon enjoy bodyboarding on.  We’re happy that she has a healthy respect for the waves here.  It’s fun to get some mums and kids together and go for a play, or have a twilight picnic or BBQ (permanent grills are available at no charge)

Beatty Park.  We go to an indoor swimming pool for babies and young children featuring slip-proof floors, spraying mushrooms, bubbling areas, and small, medium and huge slides.  Outside are Olympic size pools and picnic areas. 

The Zoo.  We are members of the zoo which means that we can pop down to the zoo for just an hour just to see a few animals, play in the very funky playground or ride on the carousel.  We went 10 times last year.

AQWA (Aquarium of WA) is a 20 minute drive – the sharks and rays in the big tank are always cool, but the local (to WA) leafy- and weedy-seadragons (species of sea-horse) are probably the neatest things there – e.g. http://www.amonline.net.au/fishes/students/focus/seadrag.htm 

Landsdale Farm was built so Perth children would grow up knowing where milk and eggs came from.  A fifteen minute drive from home, it has all your basic farm animals – horses, cows, ducks, sheep, goats, rabbits – as well as an herb garden, compost and worm display, and a shaded area with the obligatory free gas bbq for picnics. 

The WA Museum has a discovery centre where kids can open up hundreds of drawers with preserved insects, rocks, shells, other natural samples and ancient artifacts.  There are preserved birds to pet, videos to watch, puzzles to do and beanbags to sit and read books in.

The Train is a treat in its own right for Abby!  Fortunately we live walking distance to two different suburban lines, and this is the usual way to get to the Museum. 

Walk or Bike around Lake Monger – approx 5 km round trip – we usually take rolled-oats to feed to the black-swans, geese, ducks and coots. The pelicans don’t seem interested in such small morsels. 

Kings Park has a couple of great playgounds, for little kids and not quite so little kids, and a lot of bushland. 

At night, Abby and I often bathe together and she really enjoys scrubbing my back and brushing my hair!  Then she brushes her teeth and we read in bed – her favorites right now are Horrible Harriet by Australian Leigh Hobbs and A Big Ball of String, a book my friend Abby and I read when we were little and which she gave us a copy of.  We also have a tape from the local toy library of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny – from the tv movies. 

We go regularly to the library to borrow new books and are also members of our local toy library where we can borrow toys as big as cars, scooters and play kitchens to puzzles, music and computer activity cds, dress-up outfits, lego and more.  It’s run on a co-op model where each family pays dues and one parent from each family is rostered about four times a year to staff the library for two hours.  It’s an amazing way to rotate toys or to see if your child really will use a toy before you buy it. Amy’s recently joined the management committee.   
We’ve finished renovating, so the little shack by the freeway is a little less “cosy” and somewhat more accommodating, and the garden has been done too so we now have a small but comfortable space for playing, barbecuing, resting in a hammock, watching fish and a waist-high garden for growing vegetables. Interestingly, our most successful vegetables are not the ones I planted, but the ones sprouting from seeds in the compost we used as mulch.   
We’ve also made an excellent upgrade in Abby’s room:  parents of young children will understand that the problem with stacking a kid’s books on shelves the normal way – spines facing out – makes it difficult for a kid who can’t read the tites to choose a book.  Recently, Simon and I have remedied this by taking advantage of the antiquity of the front of the house which has dado rails, and use the ones in Abby’s room to display her books, with some curtain wire to hold them to the wall.  This display allows Abby to see the book covers and reach them herself, while also allowing us to rotate the books displayed and encouraging her to read new ones.

Coming Our Way?  We had a generous delegation of family in 2004, beginning with a visit from Amy’s Mom last January, Amy’s cousin Patrick last March and Simon’s sister Sarah along with her husband Tim and their children Chloe, Jack and Joe also in March. We all took a great trip first to Denmark (Western Australia), home of the best beaches and meat-pies anywhere, and then to Margaret River.  We’re looking forward to maintaining a close relationship with them so we’ve all got broadband connections and web cams now.  As should you so we can all stay a bit closer (on MSN Messenger it is amy_bachrach@hotmail.com or dr_shorthair@hotmail.com; on Yahoo Messenger it is amy_bachrach or dr_shorthair).  

There’s nothing I can say to dispute the fact that it requires some money but more importantly chunks of time to travel to Western Australia.  What I can say is that once you arrive, we’ll meet you at the airport, put you up in our cozy home, take you to beautiful beaches for snorkelling and hanging out, cook up yummy barbecues,  sip great coffee on our local café strip,  and take in the joys of Sunday music sessions at fish and chip pubs.  Or whatever.  We promise to make your visit worth the time and money. Please come see us virtually here: http://members.westnet.com.au/dr_shorthair/ or plan a real trip here: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/ .  


Zei gezunt – be well and stay close.
